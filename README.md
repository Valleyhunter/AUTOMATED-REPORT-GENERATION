Automated Report Generation is a process of creating structured, formatted, and insightful reports from raw data without requiring manual effort. Instead of spending hours preparing documents, the system automatically fetches, processes, and organizes data into professional reports. This ensures accuracy, saves time, and provides consistent outputs that can be easily shared or analyzed.
